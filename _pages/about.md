I'm a second-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), co-supervised by Prof. [Heung-Yeung Shum](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9akH-n8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Lionel M. Ni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OzMYwDIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am  an intern at [International Digital Economy Academy (IDEA)](https://idea.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://www.leizhang.org/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from Computer Science and Technology, South China University of Science and Technology in 2021. 
<!-- 
**Research Interests** -->

My research interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, object detection, and multi-modal learning.
